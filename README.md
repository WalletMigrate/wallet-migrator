# Migrator Wallet

We are leveraging EIP-7702 to temporarily delegate EOAs to smart accounts, enabling Web3 users to migrate all their assets â€” ERC-20s, NFTs, dust tokens â€” with a single click.

This delegation allows externally owned accounts (EOAs) to execute smart contract logic without converting to a smart wallet permanently. By signing a short-lived authorization, the EOA temporarily behaves like a contract account, enabling complex asset transfers such as:

ERC-20 transfers (including custom tokens)

NFT migrations (ERC-721 / ERC-1155)

Dust token swaps via integrated routers (e.g. Uniswap)

Scam token filtering (optional)

All wrapped into a single bundled transaction

## ðŸ›  How Itâ€™s Made

This project is built around the idea of simplifying wallet migrations for everyday Web3 users, using the cutting-edge capabilities of EIP-7702 and Account Abstraction.

### ðŸ”„ How It Works

The user connects their EOA wallet in the frontend.

The frontend queries token balances (ERC20s, NFTs, etc.).

The user signs an EIP-7702 authorization (not a transaction).

We build a UserOperation that includes:

The Migratorâ€™s bytecode (code)

The EIP-7702 signature (codeSignature)

The calldata for migration logic

The operation is sent to Pimlicoâ€™s bundler, which installs the bytecode temporarily onto the EOA and executes the logic â€” all in a single transaction.

Assets are migrated: transferred, swapped, and cleaned up without user friction.
